battmon.py

Simple script to record the battery voltage info and shutdown the pi zero
if we receive instruction to from the battery monitor.

Requires the Arduino Lowpower Battery Monitor described here:
  https://github.com/phreakmonkey/pizerosolar/

Must be run as root for the shutdown command to work.

I've also included "battmon.service" to run this automatically under systemd.
To install:
  - place battmon.py in /home/pi/battmon/
  - place battmon.service in /etc/systemd/system/
  - run "sudo systemctl enable battmon"
  - start the service with "sudo service battmon start"

Look for the (every 16 seconds) log info in /home/pi/battmon/battmon.log
Errors or shutdown info will be written into /var/log/syslog by systemd
